# Hype Project

This repository contains a very simple static website. To keep things straightforward, all development is done on the main branch. For additional features, you might consider a branching strategy like feature branches or release branches, but this repository intentionally maintains a single-branch setup for clarity.

## Structure

```
website/
  index.html      - Main page
  css/style.css   - Stylesheet
  js/app.js       - JavaScript
```

## Usage

Open `website/index.html` in your browser to see the site. You can host the `website` directory with any static site host.
